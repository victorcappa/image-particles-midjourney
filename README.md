<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

 
<p align="left">
 <p> 
This app is a proof of concept/MVP for a beverage company, combining images from the Midjourney API with a particle effect and camera movement to create a visually captivating animation. It showcases the company's products in an engaging and innovative way.

 </p>
 
  <h3>Challenges</h3
   <p>
The main challenge was integrating the camera movements with the ongoing particle animation. This required careful coordination and precise timing to ensure a seamless experience. However, by overcoming this challenge, I enhanced the overall visual experience and created a captivating presentation.  </p>
